## Persistence

HelloCSV supports using [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) for persisting state. This ensures that users don't lose any edits they make if the page refreshes, and allows them to come back to a partially imported state later.

The data is saved in the browsers IndexedDB store, so this data never leaves the user's browser. Therefore, if a different browser is used, the saved session will not be maintained.

HelloCSV will invalidate any state that is saved if the definition of the importer changes. For example, if the definition of an importer is changed such that a new column is added, the state previously saved will not be maintained.

### Persistence Configuration

```tsx
export interface IndexDBConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  customKey?: string;
}
```


### Usage

```tsx
<Importer
  ...
  persistenceConfig={{ enabled: true, customKey: `${currentUser.id}-import` }}
/>
```

The persistence configuration also supports a custom key, so that you as the developer can invalidate any saved importing sessions. Intuitively, the key that the data is saved under can be thought of as: `key = importer_definition + custom_key`.

<Warning>
Be careful that you don't accidentally leak information across multiple users who may be sharing the same browser with this feature.
